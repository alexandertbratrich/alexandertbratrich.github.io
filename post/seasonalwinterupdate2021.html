        <p>At the beginning of the year I did an <a href="../post/2020annualreview">annual review</a>, mostly about my sleep and health but also about my projects and »carrier«. In this review I made a set of goals for this year, as well for the coming season. Now that this season is over, let's see what worked and what didn't.</p><h2>Sleep</h2><p>Kinda ironically, while I mentioned in the annual review, that I started using a sleep tracker, since then I barely tracked my sleep. I actually wanted to make my own tracker, which wouldn't be really hard to make, I just never come around to do it. That being said, it's relative safe to say that throughout January and February, my sleep was very consistent — I woke up and when to bed every day around the same time, and I barely remember any day I slept poorly or woke up grumpy. But weirdly enough, the last two weeks since I finished my thesis (and since I have nothing major to do currently), I started to sleep worse and longer. I'm unsure if it actually has something to do with the fact that I'm now without any major deadline, but you never know.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal the rest of the year:</b> Sleep improvement and own tracker</p></div></p><h2>Diet / Workout</h2><p>Just like my sleep, I didn't really track it that well. I mean, unlike my sleep I <b>did</b> track it like I did before (every Sunday evening), but not regularly; I accidentally missed a couple of weeks. That being said, It's somewhat stable. It fluctuated somewhere between -1.1 and +0.6 kg (-2.42 and +1.32 lbs), with +0.6 kg or actual 79.7 kg (175.70 lbs) being the highest and current measurement. The human body varies between <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://gethealthyu.com/weight-changes-day/">1</a> to <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/weight-fluctuation">6</a> lbs a day (0.45 to 2.7 kg), just by existing, eating, pooping and other small influences, although I personally think 6 lbs is a bit too high. Looking at my own data, one or two lbs seems to be more correct, at least in my case; although, since I only weight myself once a week, the daily variations might not have that much of an affect.</p><p>Since I barely did anything actively to lose some weight (besides <i>not</i> drinking any pop, only water and coffee), and it stayed somewhat stable, by additionally reducing my food intake and adding <i>some</i> exercise, I should be able to slowly lose some weight.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for rest of the year:</b> Weight loss below still below 70 kg, or at least a visible improvement</p></div></p><h2>Job / University</h2><p>Now that it's already mid-March, this means that roughly two weeks ago, I reached in my master's thesis (which I'm only partly proud of. I like a few aspects of it, and what I learned in a whole, but the end result isn't that good. I thought about making a blog post about it, but it's not worth it in that regard. However, I will use some of my newly gained knowledge for future game development).</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for the rest of the year:</b> Wait for my thesis's grade and keep the lockout for a job</p></div></p><h2>Projects</h2><p>As usual, the real juicy bits are here. I tried to <i>not</i> start any new projects this season, which I think I managed to do so. The only project I actually started was the <a href="../post/startingtolearnjapanese">Hiragana Learner</a> I actually finished last month. But since that article, I realized there are a few bugs in there that keep me from using it as intended. Also, in that article, I mentioned that usually one should take around a week or so to learn all Hiragana, which I didn't — I'm not even halfway there.</p><p><b>Blue Cube Society</b></p><p>As you can see, the BCS is strong and going! It's probably one of my only projects/hobbies/habits that I keep working on, although I would have wished that this very article would have been released at the start of the month, rather than now. But the only thing that is important is that I write one post a month.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for the rest of the year:</b> Continous articles every month and still som required improvement of the design and code behind it.</p></div></p><p><b>PM Software</b></p><p>At the beginning of the year, I said I wanted to continue tracking my progress on paper and think of a fitting digital replacement. But I started to work on a new one right away and kinda forgot about my paper tracking, as you might have noticed in the paragraphs above. That being said, the new one so far consists one of a small automatic list for a morning routine (it resets every day), and a birthday reminder.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for the rest of the year:</b> Continuous tracking via paper, and a potential prototype based on my physical tracking.</p></div></p><p><b>Game Dev</b></p><p>Last time, I mentioned <i>Lost in Translation</i>, the small game jam thing we made. I still like the idea somehow, so I'll still keep it in my head. Some goes for my JS Chess version, which I kinda want to continue right away, but I think I'll keep it on the back burner for this season at least. I also mentioned the existence of other game ideas, that I haven't really continued on last season, since I was more busy with my thesis.</p><p>Since I'm now done with my thesis, I plan on taking one of my existing ideas and making it in a small, hopefully not too complicated, real, committed game. The question is just: Which one and how?</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for the rest of the year:</b> Take one idea and commit.</p></div></p><p><b>Other Projects</b></p><p>The Novel draft I mentioned before is so far on hold. I plan on starting to work on it again sometime in October, cheating a bit regarding the NaNoWriMo of 2021, so I hopefully can finish it there. Also <i>Fragments</i> is still going on, just even more fragmented.</p><h2>Goals for next season</h2><p>Just like I said in the annual review, I'm going to continue this seasonal theming. Last season was my ›Winter of Thesis‹ and my ›Winter of Physiological Fundamentals‹ which I only partly managed to commit to. This season is going to be ›The Spring of Organization‹. The focus is more on three things: Cleaning and organizing a) my physical space, b) my digital space (i.e. through backups and project management) and c) my mindset (through ).</p><p>GLHF, until the next seasonal update.</p>
