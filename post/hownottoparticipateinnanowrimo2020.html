  <span><b>TLDR:</b> I failed NaNoWriNo, but I'll continue next year.</span>
</div></p><p>I've personally heard about NaNoWriMo around a decade ago on <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.schriftsteller-werden.de/">Jackie's German blog</a> where she writes about writing. Back then, I was <i>somewhat</i> into fantasy novels (I was reading the <i>Eragon</i> series at the time), and thought about writing my own fantasy story. But I never really continued that thought.</p><p>Around ten years later, I'm <i>not</i> in high school anymore, <i>not</i> really into fantasy novels (rather more into YA, self-help, educational and graphic novels), was <i>not</i> thinking about writing since a long time, and I was in the middle of writing my master's thesis. So I did what I can do best to procrastinate on my thesis: Start another new side project. Then have said side project take over completely, until I run into unforeseen problems and abandon that one too. It’s my personal circle of hell and it's a complicated love-hate relationship.</p><h2>What is NaNoWriMo anyway?</h2><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> is an annual event where people all around the world try to write their own stories, no matter if they have been New York Times Bestsellers before or never thought about writing a story in their entire life. The only rule: trying to reach the fifty-thousand-word count by the end of November. A lot of people want to pursue their dreams for years — The hard part is actually sitting down and doing it. Once it's popped, it won't stop.</p><p>Except, the thing is, everybody can hit the word limit by just puking gibberish into their Word document and call it a day. The real goal is to write a story that you (and possible readers) will actually enjoy and that makes some sense. But that's something that can't be measured in a word count (but will later be measured through sale numbers and ratings).</p><p>Of course, the novel doesn't have to make sense by the end of November, because there are definitely going to be revisions afterwards, but it would help if the first draft wouldn't be complete nonsense. For NaNoWriMo this means: Sit down, stop worrying and write until your fingers bleed.</p><h2>So what went wrong?</h2><p>Well, I can't say for sure what exactly caused me to cancel yet another project. It's a poisonous partnership of psychological provenance prone to preventing parts of previous personal (programming) projects to prosper, provoking periodic problems.</p><p>I didn't really plan anything ahead since I only randomly reminded myself about the NaNoWriMo two days before it started. While there are <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/Pantsing">people</a> who just go into the event completely blind and it works out for them, I think for me, this might have been my first mistake.</p><p>Despite that, the first week was pretty awesome, for a harsh, US-election-filled, COVID-constrained, final-master-stressed, post-relationship-hiatal year. I enjoyed diving into a new world and into new topics. Mistake #2: I chose a setting that I was completely unfamiliar, having to research a lot of things to know how they even work, about a character at real-ish locations that I never heard about, doing things that I never experienced.</p><p>Yet, that shouldn't have been a problem. I just researched these things and, through that process, found details and things that I wouldn't have considered in the first place, which guided my story in a completely different adventure. My only problem here is, that I always try to be way too realistic about things, thus constraining myself in possibilities, creating plot holes and contradict myself. I continued by just ignoring plot holes, making a note somewhere and pretend that all is good.</p><p>With week number two everything went downhill. At first, I was super busy getting and setting up a new PC for my mom and doing other various things, so I started to fall behind on the daily word count, but still continued. I was kinda proud that I didn't use my whole day gaming and that I wrote <i>something</i> every day, even if it was just a few hundred words.</p><p>And then I've hit it, in week three. The end of my story. I skipped so many plot holes and other details that my story was basically over before I even hit the 25k word count. So, I needed to get more details, more side quests, new characters and most importantly, I skipped a huge scene around the climax, because I just didn't know how to tie everything together. And while I was busy, squeezing out details from previous scenes, the daily word count grew and grew, until a point where I would have to write for two days in one. But my mental budget just didn't have any buy-one-get-one-free discount on creativity juice — not at least without completely breaking the structure of the story that I tried to glue together the past three weeks.</p><p>I tried to get through week four, but I snapped. I didn't even reach 30k, and I was doubting why I even started the whole thing, why I wasted all my time with that, I could have done something else instead, gosh I'm a failure.</p><p>So. That's it. Now the most important question:</p><h2>What can I do better next time?</h2><p>Here are some tips, based on my experience for myself and others (in no particular order):</p><p><b>1. Prepare your environment</b> — Keep your desk clean, get rid of social media (it's bad for your anyway) and stop procrastinating through other tasks. Whatever you have to do, you can do it after your daily word limit as well.</p><p><b>2. Make yourself some time</b> — this year I was (supposed to be) busy with my thesis, next I'll <del>hopefully</del> probably have a job. I'm not going to take off a whole month for that, so it's going to be harder in that regard. Still, there is always time to write.</p><p><b>3. Don't be a perfectionist</b> — Nothing is perfect. Every book, every movie, every game, everything in the entire universe has some flaws. Everybody thinks their story is their ›baby‹ and it's going to be fantastic and huge and exciting, so it needs to be perfect. But (a) there's <b>always</b> room for improvement, you just need to know when to stop, (b) there's always a Draft #2 to fix things later, and (c) everybody has to start somewhere, even if it's not perfect. Nothing is perfect on the first try. Did I make the most perfect Beef Wellington on Christmas a few years ago? No. Did SpaceX land their Falcon 9 boosters on the first try? Of course not. It's pretty normal for authors (and creators in general), that they want to bury their first attempts at writing under their floorboards, and wish they could just start over with a perfect version. But without failure, there's no baseline for success.</p><p><b>4. Set yourself a different deadline</b> — I personally think deadlines are a good thing, I work better with deadlines than without. But since deadlines creep up fast, and the flow of words drains at some points in time, it's nice to have a few days more. So, pretend that your deadline is earlier than planned. Instead of writing 1667 words a day, try 2000 (or even more!) so you have a time buffer of five days in case of a dragging day or other unforeseen events. And even if you hit your daily goal, try to write more — your future-self will thank you for every word written.</p><p><b>5. Stop worrying about plot holes</b> — That's what the revision is for. Just get some ideas on the paper. Maybe you find some ideas you wouldn't think about if you would constrain yourself through plot details and realism.</p><p><b>6. Prepare an idea beforehand</b> — Pantsing might not be the best approach. You need at leave some outline to know where the story is going. Even if it's just a few keypoints. There are enough cheat sheets and story theories out there to take inspiration from.</p><p><b>7. If everything else fails, break the rules</b> — NaNoWriMo is basically a honor-system challenge. Nobody is forcing you to write or can control what you really do. There is no cheating, you're only cheating yourself. In fact, NaNoWriMo even encourages rebels. So, if you don't have enough time, just start in October or reuse an old story. If you don't want, or can't write a novel, just write short stories, memoires, a screenplay, or a video game script.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I talked with some of the people on the official forum. On average, around <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikiwrimo.org/wiki/NaNoWriMo&lowbar;statistics">15% of participants</a> actually reach the fifty-thousand-word threshold; on average everybody reaches around 12k. So, I'm nearly three times better than the average, yet still in the ›losing‹ majority. But losing NaNo doesn't mean losing at writing.</p><p>I'm not giving up my first draft yet. I'm proud of it and it has <i>some</i> potential to be good enough to be called a story. So I'm going to throw it somewhere in the depths of my backup system, waiting to be found in a few months, once I'm done with my master's thesis. To be taking apart, word by word, only to be mended together with golden <del>seams</del> scenes — to be a proud kintsugi-style novel.</p><p>If anyone from the NaNo forum reads this by any chance, thanks again for all the kind words.</p>
