      <div class="content">
        <p><div class="headerimage" style="background-image: url('../imgs/headers/books.jpg')"></div></p><p>When I was younger I didn't read much, but nowadays I believe I'm an avid reader, although I know I could read even more throughout the years. By popular demand (aka, at least one person asked), here's my list of all books I've ever read.</p><p>Most comments are kept extremely neutral to avoid spoilers and wrong memories. I ranked them by my personal arbitrary gut-reaction, in a totally not scientific biased way. For a book to have only a rating of 1 or 2 doesn't mean it's bad (otherwise I wouldn't have listed it at all), it probably just means it's more a non-fiction book that might still be interesting or important, but wouldn't re-read every year with enjoyment. My ›5-emoji-rating‹ can't be really compared to the usual 5-star-Amazon rating. I'm not a harsh critic. If I like a series or an author, I might like all books in that area. And in general, my rating shouldn't be taken too seriously.</p><p>Each entry also includes the date I've read them. The list of this year do not include any re-reads of previous books (like Scott Pilgrim for example).</p><h2>My 2020 Read</h2><p><div class="list">
  <div class="item"><p><b>The Fault in Our Stars</b> by <i>John Green</i></p><span>Without a doubt John Green's best work, with a great movie adaptation. Made me cry and didn't get out of my head for weeks.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</b> by <i>John Green and David Levithan</i></p><span>I like the concept of two authors taking turns writing chapters.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Turtles All the Way Down</b> by <i>John Green</i></p><span>It's John Green, so of course I would enjoy it.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Let It Snow</b> by <i>Maureen Johnson, John Green and Lauren Myracle</i></p><span>Before I read it, I thought it would be some kind of traditional christmas story (although it says ›Three Holiday Romances‹ on the cover). Turns out, it was more than that. Mrs. Johnson's story I enjoyed the most out the three; John Green's story was a bit predictable compared to his other works (but still good; I mean, they all were a bit, but I think that's the point of romances especially short ones). Overall, I enjoyed all three stories. I like the concept of three separate stories by different authors in the same setting.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Looking for Alaska</b> by <i>John Green</i></p><span>Still in the middle of reading this one, while I finished this years list. But I think it's obvious that I like John Green.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>No Plot? No Problem!</b> by <i>Chris Baty</i></p><span>Written by the guy who founded NaNoWriMo, this book is almost as old as the NaNoWriMo itself. So literally all the information in this book is available online nowadays. Still a fun read to put you in the right mindset.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Dip</b> by <i>Seth Godin</i></p><span>To be honest, it's not a good book. It feels like Mr. Godin just read about the already known concept of the Plateau, renamed it and quickly punched out a book to make a quick buck, even having the audacity to say that ›Short books are hard to write, but you made me do it.‹ Yeah, nah. It's not really going very deep into real-life examples, giving new insights or real concrete tips, just repeating the same shallow definition over and over. That being said, the message behind it is <i><b>correct</b></i> and <i><b>important</b></i>, but you can read all of it online in a fraction of the time, with even more insight.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating1">1/5 </span><span>2020</span></div></div>
</div></p><h2>All Other Books I like</h2><p><div class="list">
  <div class="item"><p><b>Licensed To Revolt (Nick Twisp #9)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>Not really much to say. It fits well into the other books.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2019</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>I'm not your Manic Pixie Dream Girl</b> by <i>Gretchen McNeil</i></p><span>My girlfriend left this one after her last trip, telling me that it's good and in mentions Ramona Flowers. It feels like a mix between ›Will Grayson, Will Grayson‹ and ›An Abundance of Katherines‹.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2019</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Hello World</b> by <i>Hannah Fry</i></p><span>Having read ›Algorithms to Live By‹ a year before, I expected the book to be similar. It's completely not, but that's not a bad thing. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Machine Learning and Big Data, without needing a degree in Computer Science.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2019</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>How To Win Friends And Influence People</b> by <i>Dale Carnegie</i></p><span>A book that's soon a hundred years old. An interesting read for any introvert like me.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2019</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Happy Together</b> by <i>Suzann and James Pawelski</i></p><span>A book that I definitely need to re-read.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2019</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Algorithms to Live By</b> by <i>Brian Christian</i></p><span>For someone who knew about all the algorithms mentioned in the book, it's an easy read. I remember that I enjoyed it a lot, but I think I actually need to re-read it to implement some of these algorithms is my life again.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2018</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Blood, Sweat and Pixels</b> by <i>Jason Schreier</i></p><span>An interesting read for anyone who wants to know a bit more behind the scenes of the gaming industry.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2018</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Things To Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension</b> by <i>Matt Parker</i></p><span>Honestly don't remember exactly when I bought/read it (or rather: I can't find it in my Excel sheet currently; kinda ironic considering Mr. Parker's passion for Excel). I just remember it was a fun and interesting read.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2018</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Ready Player One</b> by <i>Ernest Cline</i></p><span>I randomly bought and read this one at the airport in Montréal, a month after the first trailer to the movie dropped. It's extremely different from the movie, not only due to licensing, but also because huge parts of the book would be boring and/or confusing on screen.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2018</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge</b> by <i>the Project Management Institute</i></p><span>Obviously a book to a topic not for the average Joe. But if you're in the PM scene, this one is a must-have.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating1">1/5 </span><span>2018</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Revolt at the Beach (Nick Twisp #8)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>Honestly, the only thing I don't like about the series is the fact that I never can remember the right order without looking up at Wikipedia.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Revoltingly Young (Nick Twisp #6)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>I think at this point it's obvious that I'll continue to read this series as long as Mr. Payne has no <i>pain</i> to write them.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Snotgirl #1</b> by <i>Bryan Lee O'Malley and Leslie Hung</i></p><span>I loved it. Since 2017, there are actually a couple more issues that I have the urge to buy since a long time.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>An Abundance of Katherines</b> by <i>John Green</i></p><span>As my first book of John's and a nerd, it was great. Probably needs a re-read.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Young and Revolting (Nick Twisp #5)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>A further sequel to a wonderful series.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Son of Youth in Revolt (Nick Twisp #7)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>I like'em all, 'nough said.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Paper Towns</b> by <i>John Green</i></p><span>I honestly don't remember anything from that book, so I definitely need to re-read it. But since it's John Green it probably was good.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Eat What You Watch</b> by <i>Andrew Rea</i></p><span>Technically, I haven't read it completely, but it's a cook books, so it's different. As a fan from Andrew's show, it was a must-have. A made a few recipes from there, although some in different variations.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2017</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Youth in Revolt (Nick Twisp #1 - #3)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>I got this book because I've seen scenes from the movie in a fan-made music video to a song of my old-time favorite band Kakkmaddafakka. And because it has Michael Cera in it. And I loved it.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2016</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Revolting Youth (Nick Twisp #4)</b> by <i>C. D. Payne</i></p><span>A great sequel to a wonderful series.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2016</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>In Real Life</b> by <i>Cory Doctorow</i></p><span>When I started reading this graphic novel, I expected something else. Turns out it's surprisingly real and political, similar to what's going on in Venezuela.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2016</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Chronicles of Narnia Series</b> by <i>Clive S. Lewis</i></p><span>Started buying them around 2013 slowly until 2016. Read the German version. Liked them and I hope they finish the movie adaptation sometime in my lifetime.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2016</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Fellowship of the Ring</b> by <i>J. R. R. Tolkien</i></p><span>I'm probably going to make a lot of people mad, but saying I honestly didn't enjoy it that much (compared to the movies or the ›Narnia‹ series), so I didn't even read the other parts. <b>BUT</b> I don't want CGP Grey to kill me in my sleep, so I promise I'll re-read it sometime (this time as the English version) and give it a different rating.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating2">2/5 </span><span>2016</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>How to Be a Canadian</b> by <i>Will Ferguson</i></p><span>Definitely needs a refresher. Surprisingly, I can't find it.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Seconds</b> by <i>Bryan Lee O'Malley</i></p><span>Another great work by Mr. O'Malley.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Why I have Canadians</b> by <i>Will Ferguson</i></p><span>Definitely needs a refresher.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Minecraft</b> by <i>Daniel Goldberg</i></p><span>I read this one on my flight to India. I honestly don't remember much, but it gives insight into the earlier history of the best-selling game of all time.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Quidditch Through the Ages</b> by <i>J. K. Rowling</i></p><span>I read the German version. An obvious must-read for any Potterhead, to expand the world, it just don't make any sense on its on and has no narrative as it is meant to be fictional non-fiction handbook within the universe of the Potter-series.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating2">2/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</b> by <i>J. K. Rowling</i></p><span>(see my comment to: ›Quidditch Through the Ages‹)</span><div class="details"><span class="rating2">2/5 </span><span>2015</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Lost at Sea</b> by <i>Bryan Lee O'Malley</i></p><span>A more serious but also wholesome entry in Bryan O'Malley's works.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>2014</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Rosie-Project</b> by <i>Graeme Simsion</i></p><span>I read the German version. Needs a refresher. But I remember it was interesting enough, so I read the sequel as well.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2014</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Rosie-Effect</b> by <i>Graeme Simsion</i></p><span>I read the German version. Needs a refresher. But I remember it was good.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2014</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Scott Pilgrim</b> by <i>Bryan Lee O'Malley</i></p><span>Anybody who knows me personally knows that I just love the Scott Pilgrim series. It always makes me feel happy and melancholic and pensive, and basically resets my mental state back to the summer of 2013. It's the only graphic novel series that I re-read at least once a year. It's fun, it's cool and it got great a movie, short film and video game adaptation. Thank you, Mr. O'Malley for what you've done! The only thing that annoys me is the fact, that I have only read the German black-and-white addition so far.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating6">6/5 </span><span>2013</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Zombie Survival Guide</b> by <i>Max Brooks</i></p><span>Around the same time I started to read The Walking Dead series and worked on a old survival game idea, this book was (and still is) the best source about that topic.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating4">4/5 </span><span>2013</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Walking Dead #1 - #3</b> by <i>Andreas Mergenthaler</i></p><span>I've read the German version. I've never seen the series and I'm not really planning to. I liked them and might have continued to read them, but I stopped because I thought about selling them and getting the English version instead.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2013</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Golden Ratio</b> by <i>Albrecht Beutelspacher and Bernhard Petri</i></p><span>Also a German book. I read it because I wrote a paper about the golden ratio in high school.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating1">1/5 </span><span>2013</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Guess How's Back</b> by <i>Timur Vermes</i></p><span>It's kinda authetic/fitting that this is one of the books that I read the German version. It's interesting and spawned a semi-faithful movie adaptation.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating3">3/5 </span><span>2012</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>The Harry Potter Series</b> by <i>J. K. Rowling</i></p><span>Technically I don't own them (they are my sisters), and obviously they were good. I definitely need to re-read them in English at some point.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating5">5/5 </span><span>20XX</span></div></div><div class="item"><p><b>Eragon</b> by <i>Christopher Paolini</i></p><span>German version. I honestly remember nothing, except the beginning on the farm and that they butchered the adaptation.</span><div class="details"><span class="rating2">2/5 </span><span>20XX</span></div></div>
</div></p><h2>My Tsundoku-List</h2><p>The Japanese have a beautiful word for books that one has bought, but didn't read (yet): Tsundoku. These are mine.

</div></p><h2>The Future</h2><p>This is going to be one (of several) posts, that I'm going to update/repost every year, to have it up to date. I'll definitely update some of the comments once I re-read some of the books, and might add links to each book in the future.</p>
