        <p>The Annual Review is a thing that I used to do years ago when I had my old website, to have some kind of baseline for the coming year (Back then, I actually did Quarterly Reviews, so I'm thinking about continuing that). Why am I sharing this online? Because I want to be transparent, and because it gives some responsibility and commitment, to keep my promise to whoever reads my blog.</p><p>My good friend <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://mind-now.net/">Winny</a> told me several times, about the other three fundamentals that I need to focus on to feel better and thus have a better performance throughout the day: Sleep, Diet, Workout. So let's talk about my data on these first:</p><h2>Sleep</h2><p>I started using a sleep tracker in the middle of September, and by the time of writing, I wasn't done with December (and I decide to keep it that way). In total, I had 30 green dots (meaning I woke up energized and usually early), 22 red dots (meaning I slept poorly and usually overslept), and 48 grey dots (neutral) Stripped ones are nights where I don't have any data. Coincidentally, those are exactly 100 data points, which makes it easy to see that nearly half of my night I slept neutral, a nearly quarter bad and nearly a third good. Here's my takeaway:</p><p><div class="image" style="background-image: url('../imgs/headers/sleep2020.png')"></div></p><p>On average, I have 1.5 bad night a week and roughly 2 good ones. The best week was Week 43 in October, which contained no bad night and more than half of the nights were good. The worst week was Week 47 in November, with 3 bad nights and no good nights.</p><p>From a monthly perspective, I had on average 9 positive, 6.7 negative, and 14.5 neutral nights per month. Similar to the weekly insight, October more positive on average, while November was move negative on average. November's negativity might be explained through <a href="../post/hownottoparticipateinnanowrimo2020">this year's NaNoWriMo</a>, as for October, I'm unsure. The only positive event that I remember from October was my birthday (but that's not in Week 43). Interestingly, even though November is more negative (and has the worst week, and the longest series of nights without a positive sleep), November also has the longest series of nights without a negative sleep (starting at the end of October). But you can recreate my NaNoWirMo experience in my sleep data. November's weeks got consistently worse — but the same can be said about every month. On average, the first three weeks of a month gets inverse-exponentially worse; by the end, the fourth week gets slightly better and the last few nights of a month are even better. Weekday-wise, there seems to be a similar trend: Monday is somewhat positive, hits a peak on Tuesday, drops until Thursday, goes back to Monday-level, and Sunday is perfectly balanced (as all things should be). Why exactly that's the case, I can not say.</p><p>There a several disadvantages of this sleep tracking. First, I never tracked at what time I woke up and went to bed. It's pretty safe to say that the say negative nights were usually nights I woke up late, but there's should be a distinction between waking up late and waking up bad. You can wake up early and feel like crap. And you can wake up late and be energized. For me personally, that's not so much the case, but it is worth considering. Second, without any other tracking, it doesn't give me more reasoning behind bad days. I know that November was a bit bad, because I've spent the night with NaNoWriMo, but I can't say the same about the other days.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Sleep improvement (more regularly) and more detailed tracking (time and reasoning)</p></div></p><h2>Diet / Workout</h2><p>Just like my sleep, I only started tracking my weight (and calories) in mid-September, measuring every Sunday evening, with the average marked in red.</p><p><div class="image" style="background-image: url('../imgs/headers/weight2020.png')"></div></p><p>I started with 76.7 kg (x lbs), and ended on 77.1 kg (169.9 lbs). So yeah, I gained some weight (hitting a peak in my <i>current</i> weight data in the process; I know that a few years ago I was at 79.9 kg (176.1 lbs), which was my lifetime high score so far), but only slightly. My average was at 75.6 kg (166.6 lbs). But to be honest, I didn't really concentrate on my weight, since I currently have my thesis to worry about. I did <i>some</i> workout especially during the first two months, but I stopped almost completely with the start of November. And December is that time of the year when cookies and Xmas roast meat just have priority. Any (controversial) Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator tells me that, with an index of 24.7, I'm <i>just</i> about to hit overweight status (which I always honestly thought was at 80.0 kg with my height).</p><p><div class="sidenote"><p>Sidenote: Why is BMI controversial? Because it has some limitations. The scaling isn't exactly right (making larger people think they are too heavy and smaller people think they are too light; around 10% plus/minus). BMI's thresholds when somebody enters a different category is kinda arbitrary. BMI is apparently especially inaccurate for athletic people (which I'm obviously not), mainly because based on BMI alone you can't differentiate between fat and muscles.</p></div></p><p>Using Prof. Nick Trefethen's improved BMI formula, I calculate an index of roughly 24.4, which would put me into a better picture, but doesn't make a huge difference. No matter which value is right, I don't need a BMI to know that I'm more round than I used to be. But if we can believe the BMI thresholds, then I could lose up to 18 kg (39.6 lbs) and still be considered normal weight (just shy about being underweight). So let's aim for the middle at 68 kg (159.9 lbs), which would mean losing 9 kg. The CDC <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing&lowbar;weight/">says</a> slowly and steadily losing 0.45 to 0.9 kg (1 to 2 pounds) per week is healthy. If we do some math, that would mean I would need between 10 and 20 weeks to lose the targeted 9 kg.</p><p>Again, assuming the improved BMI formula is accurate (enough), using <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body&lowbar;fat&lowbar;percentage">Wikipedia's improved body fat percentage formula</a> — which takes age and gender into consideration — I would be at 18.76% body fat, which is apparently low average (just shy about fit), which I highly doubt is correct.</p><p>To compare that against some action heroes of mine, Arnold Schwarzenegger <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://bodywhat.com/?v=mtn21jvg">apparently</a> had around 7% body fat during his Mr. Olympia days. Chris Evans <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.fitmole.org/chris-evans-workout/">apparently</a> has around 11% body fat. Bruce Willis <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://celebritytall.com/bruce-willis/">apparently</a> has a BMI around 26.4. Assuming Mr. Willis' measurements are from nowadays, he would have 32% body fat (if they would be from the 80s he would have 25%, which would mean I personally would be more fit than John McClane himself. This again shows BMI's limitations regarding muscle detection).</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Weight loss below 70 kg, or at least a visible improvement</p></div></p><h2>Job / University</h2><p>This year, I had my two-ish last semesters (one finished in March, one in August and the last one going on right now). I now have to finish my thesis that is due at the start of March.
After that I should get a job (that I should have looked for during the last year; but you know, COVID-19, Anxiety, Thesis' Stress, etc.). Thankfully, I don't have to pay any rent (yet).</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Master's Graduation and Job Seeking</p></div></p><h2>Projects</h2><p>Projects are where the real deal is. I would say I have a wide range of interests, but my personal problem is that I usually can't really commit to the projects long enough. I get overwhelmed with problems, get distracted with new side projects, ditch the old one, and repeat all over. It's time to put a stop to that. Here's a short list of projects, I started or continued, and would like to continued doing:</p><p><b>Blue Cube Society</b></p><p>As you probably know, since you're here (and I assume so far all people who read this have been forced by me to read this), I started the BCS project this year. It's basically a personal blog/website for now, and since it's that, I can continue to work on it as long as I feel like it.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> A new article every month and continued improvement of the design and code behind it.</p></div></p><p><b>Novel Draft</b></p><p>As discussed in my article about <a href="../post/hownottoparticipateinnanowrimo2020">this year's NaNoWriMo</a>, I started a half-baked, unfinished first draft of a story that I thought I would never have written. I'll probably write a more detail article about the story, once it's finished.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Revision of the first draft, ideally before November, so next NaNoWriMo can be used for another new story.</p></div></p><p><b>PM Software</b></p><p>Those who know me personally, know that I like to-do-Lists, data and statistics, and that I've made several (unfinished) project management software prototypes. A few years ago, I actually finished one of them for my bachelor thesis, but it felt crappy to use. Since then, I always want to restart this project (which I did), but never finish it for some reason. I guess my problem is that I always try to include more than I need and make things unnecessarily complicated. It's just a software for me, it doesn't need to be perfect, and it just needs to fit my needs, not others.
Currently, I actually don't use any software for my project, but instead track all my progress on paper. I use a weekly list, that I can change up every week in case something needs to be corrected.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Continuous tracking via paper, and a potential prototype based on my physical tracking.</p></div></p><p><b>Fragments</b></p><p>Do you know how many accounts you have created in our lifetime? How many do you still use? ›Fragments‹ is basically my personal attempt at cleaning up old accounts, saving what's important and removing unnecessary information on the web.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Finally delete my Facebook account.</p></div></p><p><b>Lost In Translation</b></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://alexandertbratrich.itch.io/lost-in-translation">Lost In Translation</a> is a game jam prototype that was made at the <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.oneratgames.com/jamingtons.html#">oneratgame's Jamington 8</a>. I was part of a group of five students, and we made this game in 72 hours. My personal involvement wasn't as big as I expected (I mostly made the menu), since I'm not really experienced with the Unity Engine (or any Engine in general).
I like the idea of a language based puzzle game, and I'm something thinking about taking this idea and remaking it. But I'm unsure. Since this was my first game jam ever, I must say I'm not really a fan of it. 72 hours (or sometimes even less) are just too short to squeeze something out of code. Or maybe it's just me, because I'm not experienced enough, and because I need to polish things enough.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Think about remaking the game, if there's good a enough (new) scenario.</p></div></p><p><b>Game Prototypes</b></p><p>Besides the only game (if you can call it that) that we've made this year, I have several game ideas (in my head) that I want to make first prototypes of. I don't really want to get too much into detail at this point (not because of a fear of commitment, but rather because I'm unsure about the gameplay and lore, and the lore I already have I don't want to spoil), but let's just say I have a few in different genres (puzzle/adventure, sci-fi/exploration, cyberpunk, puzzle/military). Only one of them is actually far enough to have enough lore and gameplay ideas that I could start coding. But I'm not going to as long as I'm not completely sure about it.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Take that one far enough idea, and finish planning.</p></div></p><p><b>Javascript Chess</b></p><p>Unlike the game above, I would really call this a ›real‹ game (mainly because it's webbased and doesn't use any engine), yet it still is one. I think last year (or at the beginning of this year), I started making a Vue.js-chess game (which is based on an unfinished vanilla JavaScript chess game, I made in my second semester; which is based on a C++-ASCII-console version I made in my very first semester). By now it's no surprise that I never finished it, but I would like to. I know at least one person that would see that happen.</p><p><div class="goal"><p><b>Goal for next year:</b> Finish my JS-chess game.</p></div></p><p>Those are actually not all projects. I know at least two that I started this year but never finished, and countless others from previous years. I wonder why I keep doing that.</p><h2>Goals for next <del>year</del> months</h2><p>Here's the thing: New Year's resolutions suck. I guess everybody knows that, but nobody wants to admit it. CGP Grey made a <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">fantastic video</a> about alternative adjustments. In summary, instead of trying to beat a specific goal (i.e. ›losing <i>x</i> pounds in <i>y</i> days‹), Grey suggests using a theme instead. Even if you improve a thing ever so slightly, you probably would have failed any traditional New Year's resolutions, but you're still doing better than usual. Keep the theme broad and expectations low, and it's easier to improve. The second thing Grey suggests is to swap the year for a season. A year is a bit too long, you never know what changes. A season is the next step below. Months might be okay too (NaNoWriMo is also a month long), but my friend Winny told me that is takes an average of 66 days for a habit to stick (<a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.695.830&rep=rep1&type=pdf">based on a 2009 study</a>). So having a seasonal theme could be exactly the thing to change you <i>forever</i>.</p><p>I'm doing exactly <b>not</b> what Grey said, I'm going to be more specific, and actually give my seasonal resolution two themes instead: <i>›The Winter of Thesis‹</i> and <i>›The Winter of Physiological Fundamentals‹</i>. I know, doesn't really roll of the tongue, but I guess you know what I'm trying to achieve. Get better sleep and be more healthy, <i>and</i> finish my thesis.
And other difference to Grey's suggestion is that I change the length. He said a season is a nice time span, which is three months. But I'm going make it two months instead. Why? Well, my thesis is due on March 1st, two months from now. And you know what else starts in March? Spring. So next seasonal resolution (quarterly resolution? review? retrospective?) is actually going to be three months long and starts when it should be.</p><p>To summarize: For the next two months, I try to fix my sleep and lose some weight. I also finish my thesis. All other goals I've mentioned above, are treated as an optional thing and get their focus another season in another article.</p><p>Take care and have a wonderful 2021.</p>
