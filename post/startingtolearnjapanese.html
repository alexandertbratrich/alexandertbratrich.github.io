        <p>This month's article is going to be a smaller one because I'm currently stressing a bit with my thesis.</p><p>I don't know why, but every year for the last few years, around winter season, I feel like learning Japanese. Unlike my basic understanding of French, I basically have no previous more professional experience with Japanese, I could have taken a Japanese course in my second semester at university, but it got cancelled due to a lack of registrations.</p><p>I started Duolingo's course on Japanese a year or two ago, but I've heard from various places online that their course is a bit confusing and has an extremely learning curve — and they were right. I quickly abandoned the course to look for some alternatives. Duolingo starts their course like most other Japanese learning platforms do, by teaching the pronunciation and Romanization of Hiragana.</p><h2>Getting Native Support</h2><p>Those who know me personally, probably know that I use <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://slowly.app/en/">Slowly</a>, the pen pal app that mimics a real-life delay of letters going through postal service. I recently became friends with someone from Japan, so this was this year's spark that got me interested in learning Japanese again.</p><p>My Japanese friend was nice enough to give me some tips how I should approach learning Japanese. She basically told me to start with the Kana again, just as in other courses. Hiragana and Katakana, collectively known as Kana, are two of three sets of symbols used in written Japanese. Hiragana is the main one, used for the majority of words and thus usually learned first, while Katakana is primarily used for foreign words.</p><p>My friend told me that Katakana might be easier than Hiragana, but I should start with Hiragana. Kanji — the third set of glyphs — is the last thing to learn since there are thousands that make even native Japanese people struggle. I've read online that reading children's books might be a nice way to continue after Hiragana, since these books usually include basic shapes, numbers, colors, animals and common objects and phrases. But I'm not that far yet.</p><h2>Getting Digital Support</h2><p>I'm not here to teach you how to learn Japanese, I'm not qualified to do so, not even at a later stage. I will however, promote a little thing I made.</p><p>I made a Hiragana Flash Card thing. I know there are literally hundreds out there on the web and in various App Stores, but I just wanted to make my own, to get familiar with the characters, and to try some new coding. It's not finished yet, since so far it only supports Hiragana (Katakana and Kanji being added later once I'm familiar enough with Hiragana), but you check it out yourself <a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://alexandertbratrich.github.io/japanese/">here</a>. Unlike the rest of my page, this one needs javascript. I recommend you to use it on PC instead of on mobile, since — like the rest of my page — it isn't opimized for mobile yet, and I guess it might actually be harder to use.</p><p>There are a few little details that I'll fix sometime afterwards, for example, if you only have one card left, and it's a character that you have literally no idea what it's supposed to be, it won't show me the solution, because it immediately mixes it back into the pile since it's the last card. The positioning of the whole pile and the bottom cards need some adjustment (needs to be according to screen size). Also, since the cards are a pile that kinda fades into the background, you can't really tell how many cards are left. I'm not sure if that's really a problem, but maybe it could help if that wouldn't be the case. An easy fix for that would be to just <i>not</i> hide the pile in the shadow (or not as much), but I think it looks more intimidating than helpful to see the whole pile.</p><p>I've read online that it shouldn't take longer than a week or so to learn all Kana, at least most languages classes use around a week before moving on to different topics. For me, this might not be the case, since learning Japanese is not my number one priority, and I'm also still learning French in the meantime. Still, my own trainer thingy should help me get some routine into it.</p>
