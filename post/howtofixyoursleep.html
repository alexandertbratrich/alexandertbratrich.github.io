        <p>This is a collection of tips I've found online that are part of <a href="../post/2020annualreview">this season's plan</a> to improve my sleep. Links to all sources at the end.</p><h2>Preparing your sleep</h2><p><b>Keep your room for sleeping</b></p><p>Your bedroom isn't called like that for nothing. Try to avoid bringing work or other distracting things into the bedroom, the same way you should keep bringing distracting things into your workroom. So, if possible don't put a TV or PC in your bedroom. Keeping these two areas separate helps your mind from thinking about work in your bed. Style your room in a comfortable and relaxing way to get your head into the right mindset every night. A blue colour scheme might promote relaxation, change your sheets regularly and clean the rest of the room as well.</p><p>You might want to set up some relaxing candles (to reduce the amount of light) or introduce some pleasant smells (lemon, lavender, chamomile, marjoram) into your room. But be careful to not knock them over.</p><p><b>Food</b></p><p>Try to avoid eating large and rich food at least two or three hours before you go to bed. If you really get hungry in the evening, eat a light snack (something that's not spicy, high in carbohydrates, sugar and fat; maybe a protein bar or a banana) and drink a glass of water or milk (but not too much as it might keep you awake). But it might also be a sign that you might need to adjust your whole diet, so you don't get hungry in the night. A warm relaxing tea or cocoa might also be a way for you to get sleepy, as long as it doesn't contain caffeine (see below). Maybe a chamomile tea? Herbal teas in general, like peppermint, ginger or valerian, <i>should</i> be fine.</p><p>On the other side, going to bed with an empty stomach isn't great either. Food like yoghurt, tuna, soy beans, peanuts or anything other with high protein help produce serotonin that relaxes you. Try to avoid drinking too much one or two hours before you go to bed.</p><p><b>Temperature Adjustment</b></p><p>I think it's obvious to say, that if you shiver or sweat while you try to sleep that your room temperature is wrong. Experiment around with different temperatures. Especially cold feet might keep you awake. Sleeping naked also helps your body to regulate the temperature. Between 16° and 19° Celsius (60 - 67° Fahrenheit) is ideal.</p><p>If you still feel too cold when going to bed, try doing some light stretching exercises to warm up (but not too much, otherwise you'll be to active). Or obviously get another layer of clothing or blanket. If for some reason it's freezing all the time, you might want to invest in a heated mattress or blanket, or a traditional hot water bottle.
The other way around, if you're too hot, drink something cool, let in some fresh air, turn on a fan, maybe even put your pillow in the fridge.</p><p><b>Things</b></p><p>You probably already know about the blue light of displays that keep tricking your mind into thinking it's still day time. Try to avoid using your phone or other electrics at least one or two hours before going to bed, and set them up to use a dark mode or night shift mode, if possible. In general, set your phone into silent mode (or turn it off) and put it far away from the bed.</p><p>Read a simple book to make your eyes tired.</p><p>Take a relaxing bath or shower in the evening, which will make your body cool down and relax afterwards.</p><p><b>Block the light</b></p><p>The darker the room the more likely it is to sleep in and keep asleep. Close your curtains, shut your door and try to block any small LEDs or other light sources. If you can't do any or some of these things, or just want to make sure, you can use a sleeping mask as well. If possible reduce your overall light at an hour or two before going to bed.</p><p>Although rare, for some people complete darkness isn't right, they might prefer a soft night light due to the fear of darkness. Although I would say it's a different problem entirely. Why would you be afraid in the darkness of your own safe home?</p><h2>Sleeping In</h2><p><b>Mindset Adjustment</b></p><p>To sleep in, you need to shutdown your mind. Once you're laying down, imagine yourself sleeping. Don't thing about any problems or about the next day. Or imagine some relaxing creative setting.</p><p>One way to get your mind clutter-free is to write down your things, maybe by making a to-do list of the next morning, writing down happy things that might happen tomorrow or simply writing a traditional diary.</p><p>If you realize that you're not sleeping in as fast as you want, don't check the time. Don't worry about it. Worrying about it makes you stay up even longer. Just go back into your happy place.</p><p>You might also want to try some mindfulness exercises. Just imagine the outline of your body, slowly trace it in your head. Feel the way your body lies on the mattress.</p><p><b>Relaxing Sounds or noise</b></p><p>Some people need to listen to noise to drone out the thoughts in their head. There are several great apps and playlists out there to fill your head with static white noise, thunder sounds, or one of the millions of ASMR videos. Repetitive, ambient and white-noise-like sound (like rain or a beach) gently drifts you into sleep.
If you don't want to wear ear-/headphones while you lay (because it might be uncomfortable on your ears), and you don't want to have a speaker set up all night, you can set up a fan instead, or open up a window for some street/wind noise. There are also physical sound machines available.</p><p>For others, the problem might be the other way around, due to a snoring partner or a noisy neighbourhood. Try noise-cancelling earplugs.</p><p><b>Positioning</b></p><p>Different sleeping positions can give you different experiences, so you might want to try out different ones.</p><p>Sleeping on the side is in general the preferred way, but if your legs start to hurt, try playing an additional pillow between them. Apparently, sleeping on the left side is better than the right, as it aids digestion.</p><p>Sleeping on the back might encourage sleep paralysis or snoring, while sleeping on the stomach might be uncomfortable for your organs or give you trouble sleeping. In this case, it might help to put your pillow under your hip instead of your head.</p><p>In general, try to keep your body, especially your neck, straight, centred and aligned with the bed as an improper position might introduce pain. If your pillow is too flat, your head might tilt backwards too much, vice versa, a pillow that's too high might give your neck pain.</p><p>Once you actually sleep its near impossible to control your position, since your body is supposed to shut down. So if you remember that you woke up in a different position as you went to bed, it might be a sign that you haven't slept deep enough.</p><p><b>Breathing exercises</b></p><p>Take some deep breaths. Inhale deep, keep it in for a moment and let it out as slowly as possible. You can count while doing this, but I personally recommend not doing so to not think too much about counting itself. Repeat this for as long as you need.</p><p>There are also progressive muscle relaxation exercises, starting from your toes up to the head. You flex your muscles from that region for a few seconds and then let go. Relax for a few seconds, then repeat with the next muscle group.</p><h2>Waking Up</h2><p>If you have trouble staying awake once your alarm goes off, try to place it on the other side of the room to force you to get up. Just don't lay back down! Do not press snooze, it just will make things worse. If you have a partner or roommate that wakes up with or ahead of you, tell them to keep you awake. It might also help to put a sticky note onto your alarm to remember you to keep awake.</p><p>Let in some cold fresh air to clean the room. If the room turns cold, your body will have trouble sleeping in. Wash your face, maybe take a cold shower (or switch a lot between hot and cold, to increase the blood flow in your body), and do some light 30-minute exercise to wake you up physically.</p><p>Get a healthy breakfast, preferably before 10 AM and within an hour after you woke up. Eggs, yoghurt, almonds, chicken all have dopamine and norepinephrine that stimulates the brain. Also drink some water, or a coffee (but not too much). Fresh cold fruits get your body going through natural sugars. Even if you don't feel like eating anything, you need a small bite to get your metabolism going.</p><p>And obviously, open up the curtains. Natural light makes you feel more awake than artificial. Maybe go outside. Early exposure to direct sunlight produces more melatonin during the day that regulates your sleeping pattern.</p><h2>Life long adjustments</h2><p><b>...to you health</b></p><p>Smoking and drinking affects your sleep as well. Try to avoid it, not only for a good sleep, but for a healthier life in general.
If you need coffee to be productive, try to avoid drinking it in the evening or even afternoon. Depending on the brand/kind of coffee and on your body, caffeine can influence your body 8 up to 12 hours after consumption. The same obviously goes to coke, black tea, cocoa and other food or drinks containing caffeine and sugar, especially energy drinks or soda.</p><p>Alcohol will make you sleepy, but also reduces your quality of sleep, because your body is busy working on the sugars. In the worst case, it might even make you feel dizzy and keep you from sleeping at all.</p><p>If, after all these tips you still feel super energized at night, you might not get enough exercise during the day. Exercise 5 days a week, but try to avoid doing exercise less than two or three hours before bedtime.</p><p>You might also have other things in your life that keep worrying you during the night. In general, try to make your life more relaxing. Maybe pick up the habit of meditation.</p><p><b>... to your time</b></p><p>Try to keep the time you sleep in and wake up around the same time, even on the weekend or on days you don't work. I know this might not be possible for people with switching shifts, but a regular sleeping pattern in really important. If you adjust your sleeping time to a new one, do it gradually, as varying your sleeping patterns for more than an hour breaks your rhythm. You might feel sleepy or uncomfortable during your adjustment time, so if you try out new things, try to them out for a longer period of time.</p><p>Also, you might want to reduce or increase the time you sleep. Normally, around 8 hours are recommended for an adult, but you might wake up more energized if you sleep less. If possible, try to sleep for a week or two without any alarm, and track at what time your naturally wake up. It might be different from what you expect.</p><p>There are also apps with special alarm clocks that record your sleeping sounds and movement of the bed to determine how long and how well you actually sleep. Some even adjust the alarm clock to wake you up in a less deep phase. If you wear a wearable fitness tracking device, these might be able to do the same with an even more precise result. Although, I personally haven't tried this yet.</p><p><b>Other Tips</b></p><p>One thing that <i>could</i> help, but I personally avoid is the use of sleeping pills. But this can lead to addiction/dependence, or other potential lethal side effects. Magnesium supplements might also help with insomnia.</p><p>One tip that I haven't tried out yet is to replace your mattress after five to seven years in use. The surface might be uncomfortable or titled. Some mattresses, like memory foam ones, let you adjust the mould, firmness around you, reducing pressure points.</p><p>For some people, taking naps during the day might help to improve their main sleep during the night. For me, and probably many others however, it might make do the exact opposite.</p><p><b>Routine is Key</b></p><p>This is the most important tip. Just like with all things in life, routine is key. Without documenting your sleep quality, you won't know what to adjust. Maybe you had trouble sleeping because of something specific you did that day. By tracking what you did during your day and when you go in and out of bed, you can see any patterns that might be the reason you're still awake.</p><p>Try doing the same steps in your sleep routine every day, to get your body to relax quicker, as it gets used to avoiding temptations. It might take a few weeks if even months to get you into the habit. Once the habit sticks, your body gets ready for sleep naturally through your bedtime ritual.</p><h2>Personal Conclusion</h2><p>Of course, not all these tips might not work for everybody, so experiment around! I personally use a sleeping mask since a long time, and listen to some ASMR breathing exercises while sleeping. I don't smoke, only drink rarely, and only drink one single coffee in the morning. Throughout the day, I also only drink water. I don't use my phone as an alarm, but rather a watch that I keep on the other side of the room.</p><p><b>Sources</b></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Sleep-In">wikiHow — How to Sleep In</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Sleep-Better">wikiHow — 6 Ways to Sleep Better</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.health/Wake-Up-Easily">wikiHow — How to Wake Up Easily</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-to-Sleep">wikiHow — How to Get to Sleep</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fall-Asleep">wikiHow — 5 Ways to Fall Asleep</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Sleep-Comfortably-on-a-Cold-Night">wikiHow — How to Sleep Comfortably on a Cold Night</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Sleep-Comfortably-on-a-Hot-Night">wikiHow — How to Sleep Comfortably on a Hot Night</a></p><p><a target="&lowbar;blank" class="external" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Quality-Sleep">wikiHow — How to Get Quality Sleep</a></p>
